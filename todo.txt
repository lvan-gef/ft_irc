Channels when more then 1 they are separted by ','
Kick also separted by ','
When send invited put it in the invited list, when channel is invite only check the list and if in the list then accept it via join  (almost done)
USER we need to check if we have 4 parameters {USERNAME 0 *:REALNAME}  if realname is not send then then it send 'realname' otherwise send back NOTENEOUGHPARA
everywhere we look for nickname we need to remove toupper or make function out of it
check if we have func for setUsername and what the command for it is
